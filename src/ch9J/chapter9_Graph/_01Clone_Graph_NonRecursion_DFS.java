/*Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains 
 * a label and a list of its neighbors.

How we serialize an undirected graph:

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator 
for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains 
three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), 
thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:

   1
  / \
 /   \
0 --- 2
     / \
     \_/
