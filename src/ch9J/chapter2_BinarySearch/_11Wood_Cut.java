/*
 * Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). 
 * Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than 
 * k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from
  the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.

 Notice

You couldn't cut wood into float length.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
For L=[232, 124, 456], k=7, return 114.

Challenge 
O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.
